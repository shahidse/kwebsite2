    resourcesCard1: `Yes, 429.62Hz and harmonics is recognized as a water frequency,
                meaning it is believed to enhance the structuring, energy
                coherence, and bioavailability of water. This frequency is
                associated with harmonizing water molecules and improving their
                alignment, making it more efficient for cellular hydration and
                energy transfer. Why 429.62 Hz is Considered a Water Frequency
                Molecular Coherence & Structuring Water molecules can form
                hexagonal structures under specific conditions. 429.62 Hz is
                thought to resonate with this hexagonal structuring, helping to
                organize water into a more biocompatible and high-energy state.
                Enhanced Hydration & Absorption Structured water absorbs into
                cells more efficiently than unstructured water. This frequency
                may improve cellular uptake and hydration, optimizing biological
                functions. Charge & Energy Retention Water exposed to harmonic
                frequencies can store and transmit energy. 429.62 Hz is believed
                to infuse water with a balanced charge, increasing its vitality
                and energetic potential. Synergy with Healing Frequencies This
                frequency works well with other healing frequencies, such as:
                528 Hz (DNA repair & harmony) 741 Hz (detoxification &
                cleansing) 384 Hz (throat chakra & water communication) Using
                these together may enhance the bioenergetic properties of water.
                Influence on Consciousness & Intent Water is highly programmable
                (as demonstrated in Dr. Masaru Emoto’s research). 429.62 Hz may
                enhance water’s ability to hold intentions, making it ideal for
                manifestation, healing, and high-vibrational programming. How to
                Use 429.62 Hz for Structuring Water Sound Exposure: Play the
                429.62 Hz frequency near your water for 10-30 minutes. Crystal
                Amplification: Place clear quartz, shungite, or amethyst around
                the water container. Sunlight or Moonlight Charging: Expose the
                water to natural light while playing the frequency. Intention
                Programming: Hold the water and focus on your desired intention
                while it’s being structured.`,
    resourcesCard2: `You know about probiotics, but do you know about Psychobiotics?
                👉 Probiotics which act on the gut-brain connection to improve
                mental wellbeing are known as Psychobiotics. 👉 Through the
                gut-brain connection, Psychobiotics are able to stimulate
                neurotransmitter production and reduce inflammation, improving
                mental health. 👉 Psychobiotics are known to improve outcomes
                and alleviate negative symptoms experienced in ASD, ADHD and
                Depression, and relieve symptoms such as tremors and mobility
                issues in Parkinson's Disease. 👉 An added benefit of
                Psychobiotics is their ability to accelerate post-exercise
                recovery and improve athletic performance, meaning you can take
                care of your mind and body at the same time. 👉 Psychobiotic
                strains like PS128 are backed by pioneering scientific research
                and have been proven effective in clinical trials, making them a
                trustworthy way you can find relief and get back to mental
                wellbeing.`,

    resourcesCard1: `ہاں، 429.62 ہرٹز اور اس کے ہارمونکس کو پانی کی فریکوئنسی کے طور پر تسلیم کیا جاتا ہے، یعنی یہ مانا جاتا ہے کہ یہ پانی کی ساخت، توانائی کی ہم آہنگی، اور بایو دستیابی کو بہتر بناتا ہے۔ یہ فریکوئنسی پانی کے مالیکیولز کو ہم آہنگ کرنے اور ان کی ترتیب کو بہتر بنانے سے وابستہ ہے، جس سے یہ خلیاتی ہائیڈریشن اور توانائی کی منتقلی کے لیے زیادہ مؤثر ہو جاتا ہے۔

کیوں 429.62 ہرٹز کو پانی کی فریکوئنسی سمجھا جاتا ہے؟

مالیکیولر ہم آہنگی اور ساخت: پانی کے مالیکیول مخصوص حالات میں مسدسی ساخت بنا سکتے ہیں۔ 429.62 ہرٹز کو اس مسدسی ساخت کے ساتھ ہم آہنگ سمجھا جاتا ہے، جو پانی کو زیادہ موافق اور اعلی توانائی والی حالت میں منظم کرنے میں مدد دیتا ہے۔

بہتر ہائیڈریشن اور جذب: منظم شدہ پانی خلیوں میں غیر منظم پانی کی نسبت زیادہ مؤثر طریقے سے جذب ہوتا ہے۔ یہ فریکوئنسی خلیاتی جذب اور ہائیڈریشن کو بہتر بنا سکتی ہے، جس سے حیاتیاتی افعال بہتر ہوتے ہیں۔

چارج اور توانائی کا تحفظ: وہ پانی جو ہم آہنگ فریکوئنسیز کے سامنے ہوتا ہے، توانائی کو محفوظ اور منتقل کر سکتا ہے۔ 429.62 ہرٹز کو پانی میں متوازن چارج داخل کرنے کا باعث سمجھا جاتا ہے، جس سے اس کی حیاتیت اور توانائی کی صلاحیت میں اضافہ ہوتا ہے۔

شفا بخش فریکوئنسیز کے ساتھ مطابقت: یہ فریکوئنسی دیگر شفا بخش فریکوئنسیز جیسے کہ 528 ہرٹز (ڈی این اے کی مرمت اور ہم آہنگی)، 741 ہرٹز (ڈیٹوکس اور صفائی)، اور 384 ہرٹز (گلے کے چکر اور پانی کی مواصلت) کے ساتھ اچھی طرح کام کرتی ہے۔ ان کو ایک ساتھ استعمال کرنے سے پانی کی بایو انرجیٹک خصوصیات میں اضافہ ہو سکتا ہے۔

شعور اور نیت پر اثر: پانی انتہائی پروگرام ایبل ہے (جیسا کہ ڈاکٹر مسارو ایموٹو کی تحقیق سے ثابت ہوتا ہے)۔ 429.62 ہرٹز پانی کی نیت کو محفوظ رکھنے کی صلاحیت میں اضافہ کر سکتا ہے، جس سے یہ تجلی، شفا، اور اعلی کمپن پروگرامنگ کے لیے مثالی ہو جاتا ہے۔

پانی کی ساخت کے لیے 429.62 ہرٹز کا استعمال کیسے کریں؟

    آواز کی نمائش: پانی کے قریب 10-30 منٹ کے لیے 429.62 ہرٹز کی فریکوئنسی چلائیں۔
    کرسٹل ایمپلیفیکیشن: پانی کے برتن کے ارد گرد شفاف کوارٹز، شنگائٹ، یا ایمیتھسٹ رکھیں۔
    سورج یا چاند کی روشنی چارجنگ: فریکوئنسی چلاتے وقت پانی کو قدرتی روشنی میں رکھیں۔
    نیت پروگرامنگ: پانی کو پکڑیں اور اس کے ڈھانچے کے دوران اپنی مطلوبہ نیت پر توجہ مرکوز کریں۔

    resourcesCard2: `کیا آپ پروبائیوٹکس کے بارے میں جانتے ہیں، لیکن کیا آپ سائیکوبائیوٹکس کے بارے میں جانتے ہیں؟
👉 وہ پروبائیوٹکس جو آنت-دماغ کے تعلق پر کام کرتے ہیں تاکہ ذہنی صحت کو بہتر بنایا جا سکے، انہیں سائیکوبائیوٹکس کہا جاتا ہے۔
👉 آنت-دماغ کے تعلق کے ذریعے، سائیکوبائیوٹکس نیوروٹرانسمیٹر کی پیداوار کو متحرک کرنے اور سوزش کو کم کرنے کے قابل ہوتے ہیں، جس سے ذہنی صحت بہتر ہوتی ہے۔
👉 سائیکوبائیوٹکس کو آٹزم اسپیکٹرم ڈس آرڈر (ASD)، اٹینشن ڈیفیسٹ ہائپریکٹیوٹی ڈس آرڈر (ADHD) اور ڈپریشن میں مثبت نتائج دینے اور ان کی منفی علامات کو کم کرنے کے لیے جانا جاتا ہے، نیز پارکنسنز کی بیماری میں جھٹکوں اور حرکت کے مسائل کو کم کرنے میں مدد دیتا ہے۔
👉 سائیکوبائیوٹکس کا ایک اضافی فائدہ یہ ہے کہ یہ ورزش کے بعد صحت یابی کے عمل کو تیز کرتے ہیں اور ایتھلیٹک کارکردگی کو بہتر بناتے ہیں، جس کا مطلب ہے کہ آپ اپنے دماغ اور جسم دونوں کا خیال رکھ سکتے ہیں۔
👉 سائیکوبائیوٹک اقسام جیسے PS128 جدید سائنسی تحقیق سے ثابت شدہ ہیں اور کلینیکل ٹرائلز میں مؤثر پائی گئی ہیں، جس سے یہ ایک قابلِ اعتماد طریقہ بنتا ہے جس کے ذریعے آپ راحت پا سکتے ہیں اور اپنی ذہنی صحت کو بحال کر سکتے ہیں۔`,

    resourcesCard1: `Sí, 429.62 Hz y sus armónicos son reconocidos como una frecuencia del agua, lo que significa que se cree que mejora la estructuración, la coherencia energética y la biodisponibilidad del agua. Esta frecuencia está asociada con la armonización de las moléculas de agua y la mejora de su alineación, haciéndola más eficiente para la hidratación celular y la transferencia de energía.

    ¿Por qué se considera 429.62 Hz una frecuencia del agua?

    Coherencia molecular y estructuración: Las moléculas de agua pueden formar estructuras hexagonales bajo condiciones específicas. Se cree que 429.62 Hz resuena con esta estructuración hexagonal, ayudando a organizar el agua en un estado más biocompatible y de alta energía.

    Hidratación y absorción mejoradas: El agua estructurada se absorbe en las células de manera más eficiente que el agua no estructurada. Esta frecuencia puede mejorar la absorción celular y la hidratación, optimizando las funciones biológicas.

    Retención de carga y energía: El agua expuesta a frecuencias armónicas puede almacenar y transmitir energía. Se cree que 429.62 Hz infunde al agua con una carga equilibrada, aumentando su vitalidad y potencial energético.

    Sinergia con frecuencias de sanación: Esta frecuencia funciona bien con otras frecuencias curativas, como: 528 Hz (reparación del ADN y armonía), 741 Hz (desintoxicación y limpieza) y 384 Hz (chakra de la garganta y comunicación con el agua). Usarlas juntas puede mejorar las propiedades bioenergéticas del agua.

    Influencia en la conciencia e intención: El agua es altamente programable (como lo demuestra la investigación del Dr. Masaru Emoto). 429.62 Hz puede mejorar la capacidad del agua para retener intenciones, haciéndola ideal para la manifestación, la sanación y la programación de alta vibración.

    ¿Cómo usar 429.62 Hz para estructurar el agua?

        Exposición al sonido: Reproduce la frecuencia de 429.62 Hz cerca del agua durante 10-30 minutos.
        Amplificación con cristales: Coloca cuarzo claro, shungita o amatista alrededor del recipiente de agua.
        Carga con luz solar o lunar: Expón el agua a la luz natural mientras se reproduce la frecuencia.
        Programación de intención: Sostén el agua y concéntrate en la intención deseada mientras se estructura.`,
    resourcesCard2: `¿Conoces los probióticos, pero sabes sobre los psicobióticos?
👉 Los probióticos que actúan en la conexión intestino-cerebro para mejorar el bienestar mental se conocen como psicobióticos.
👉 A través de la conexión intestino-cerebro, los psicobióticos pueden estimular la producción de neurotransmisores y reducir la inflamación, mejorando la salud mental.
👉 Se sabe que los psicobióticos mejoran los resultados y alivian los síntomas negativos experimentados en el Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA), el Trastorno por Déficit de Atención e Hiperactividad (TDAH) y la Depresión, además de reducir síntomas como los temblores y problemas de movilidad en la enfermedad de Parkinson.
👉 Un beneficio adicional de los psicobióticos es su capacidad para acelerar la recuperación post-ejercicio y mejorar el rendimiento deportivo, lo que significa que puedes cuidar tu mente y cuerpo al mismo tiempo.
👉 Cepas psicobióticas como PS128 están respaldadas por investigaciones científicas pioneras y han demostrado ser efectivas en ensayos clínicos, lo que las convierte en una forma confiable de encontrar alivio y recuperar el bienestar mental.`,

    resourcesCard1: `Oui, 429.62 Hz et ses harmoniques sont reconnus comme une fréquence de l’eau, ce qui signifie qu’on pense qu’elle améliore la structuration, la cohérence énergétique et la biodisponibilité de l’eau. Cette fréquence est associée à l’harmonisation des molécules d’eau et à l’amélioration de leur alignement, les rendant plus efficaces pour l’hydratation cellulaire et le transfert d’énergie.

      Pourquoi 429.62 Hz est-elle considérée comme une fréquence de l’eau ?

      Cohérence moléculaire et structuration: Les molécules d’eau peuvent former des structures hexagonales dans certaines conditions spécifiques. 429.62 Hz est censée résonner avec cette structuration hexagonale, aidant à organiser l’eau dans un état plus biocompatible et énergétiquement élevé.

      Hydratation et absorption améliorées: L’eau structurée est absorbée plus efficacement par les cellules que l’eau non structurée. Cette fréquence peut améliorer l’absorption cellulaire et l’hydratation, optimisant ainsi les fonctions biologiques.

      Rétention de charge et d’énergie: L’eau exposée à des fréquences harmoniques peut stocker et transmettre de l’énergie. On pense que 429.62 Hz infuse l’eau avec une charge équilibrée, augmentant sa vitalité et son potentiel énergétique.

      Synergie avec les fréquences de guérison: Cette fréquence fonctionne bien avec d’autres fréquences curatives, telles que 528 Hz (réparation de l’ADN et harmonie), 741 Hz (désintoxication et purification), et 384 Hz (chakra de la gorge et communication avec l’eau). Les utiliser ensemble peut améliorer les propriétés bioénergétiques de l’eau.

      Influence sur la conscience et l’intention: L’eau est hautement programmable (comme l’a démontré la recherche du Dr Masaru Emoto). 429.62 Hz peut améliorer la capacité de l’eau à conserver des intentions, ce qui la rend idéale pour la manifestation, la guérison et la programmation à haute vibration.

      Comment utiliser 429.62 Hz pour structurer l’eau ?

          Exposition au son: Jouez la fréquence 429.62 Hz près de votre eau pendant 10 à 30 minutes.
          Amplification par cristaux: Placez du quartz clair, de la shungite ou de l’améthyste autour du récipient d’eau.
          Chargement à la lumière du soleil ou de la lune: Exposez l’eau à la lumière naturelle tout en jouant la fréquence.
          Programmation d’intention: Tenez l’eau et concentrez-vous sur votre intention souhaitée pendant qu’elle est structurée.`,
    resourcesCard2: `Vous connaissez les probiotiques, mais connaissez-vous les psychobiotiques ?
👉 Les probiotiques qui agissent sur la connexion intestin-cerveau pour améliorer le bien-être mental sont appelés psychobiotiques.
👉 Grâce à la connexion intestin-cerveau, les psychobiotiques peuvent stimuler la production de neurotransmetteurs et réduire l'inflammation, améliorant ainsi la santé mentale.
👉 Les psychobiotiques sont connus pour améliorer les résultats et atténuer les symptômes négatifs observés dans l'autisme (TSA), le trouble du déficit de l'attention avec hyperactivité (TDAH) et la dépression, ainsi que pour soulager des symptômes tels que les tremblements et les problèmes de mobilité dans la maladie de Parkinson.
👉 Un avantage supplémentaire des psychobiotiques est leur capacité à accélérer la récupération après l'exercice et à améliorer la performance sportive, ce qui signifie que vous pouvez prendre soin de votre esprit et de votre corps en même temps.
👉 Des souches psychobiotiques comme PS128 sont soutenues par des recherches scientifiques de pointe et ont prouvé leur efficacité lors d'essais cliniques, en faisant une solution fiable pour retrouver un bien-être mental.`,

    resourcesCard1: `نعم، 429.62 هرتز والتوافقيات معترف بها كتردد مائي، مما يعني أنه يُعتقد أنها تعزز بنية وتماسك الطاقة وقابلية الاستخدام الحيوي للماء. يرتبط هذا التردد بتناغم جزيئات الماء وتحسين محاذاتها، مما يجعلها أكثر كفاءة لترطيب الخلايا ونقل الطاقة. لماذا يُعتبر 429.62 هرتز ترددًا مائيًا؟ التماسك الجزيئي والبنية يمكن أن تشكل جزيئات الماء هياكل سداسية تحت ظروف معينة. يُعتقد أن 429.62 هرتز يتناغم مع هذا الهيكل السداسي، مما يساعد على تنظيم الماء في حالة أكثر توافقًا حيويًا وطاقة عالية. تحسين الترطيب والامتصاص يمتص الماء المنظم في الخلايا بشكل أكثر كفاءة من الماء غير المنظم. قد يحسن هذا التردد امتصاص الخلايا والترطيب، مما يحسن الوظائف البيولوجية. الشحن والاحتفاظ بالطاقة يمكن للماء المعرض للترددات التوافقية تخزين ونقل الطاقة. يُعتقد أن 429.62 هرتز يضخ الماء بشحنة متوازنة، مما يزيد من حيويته وإمكاناته الطاقية. التآزر مع الترددات العلاجية يعمل هذا التردد بشكل جيد مع الترددات العلاجية الأخرى، مثل: 528 هرتز (إصلاح الحمض النووي والتناغم) 741 هرتز (إزالة السموم والتنظيف) 384 هرتز (شاكرا الحلق والتواصل المائي) قد يؤدي استخدام هذه الترددات معًا إلى تعزيز الخصائص البيولوجية الطاقية للماء. التأثير على الوعي والنوايا الماء قابل للبرمجة بشكل كبير (كما هو موضح في أبحاث الدكتور ماسارو إيموتو). قد يعزز 429.62 هرتز قدرة الماء على الاحتفاظ بالنوايا، مما يجعله مثاليًا للتحقيق، الشفاء، والبرمجة عالية الاهتزاز. كيفية استخدام 429.62 هرتز لتنظيم الماء التعرض للصوت: شغل تردد 429.62 هرتز بالقرب من الماء لمدة 10-30 دقيقة. تضخيم البلورات: ضع الكوارتز الشفاف، الشونجايت، أو الأميثست حول وعاء الماء. شحن ضوء الشمس أو القمر: عرض الماء للضوء الطبيعي أثناء تشغيل التردد. برمجة النوايا: احمل الماء وركز على نيتك المطلوبة أثناء تنظيمه.`,
    resourcesCard2: `هل تعرف عن البروبيوتيك، ولكن هل تعرف عن السيكوبيوتيك؟ 👉 البروبيوتيك التي تعمل على اتصال الأمعاء والدماغ لتحسين الصحة العقلية تُعرف باسم السيكوبيوتيك. 👉 من خلال اتصال الأمعاء والدماغ، يمكن للسيكوبيوتيك تحفيز إنتاج الناقلات العصبية وتقليل الالتهاب، مما يحسن الصحة العقلية. 👉 يُعرف عن السيكوبيوتيك تحسين النتائج وتخفيف الأعراض السلبية التي يعاني منها الأشخاص المصابون بالتوحد، اضطراب فرط الحركة ونقص الانتباه، والاكتئاب، وتخفيف الأعراض مثل الرعاش ومشاكل الحركة في مرض باركنسون. 👉 فائدة إضافية للسيكوبيوتيك هي قدرتها على تسريع التعافي بعد التمارين وتحسين الأداء الرياضي، مما يعني أنه يمكنك الاعتناء بذهنك وجسمك في نفس الوقت. 👉 سلالات السيكوبيوتيك مثل PS128 مدعومة بأبحاث علمية رائدة وثبتت فعاليتها في التجارب السريرية، مما يجعلها طريقة موثوقة يمكنك من خلالها العثور على الرجوع إلى الصحة العقلية.`,
    deviceTitle: `تعليمات لتطبيق Resonance Healing`,
    devicesParagraph1: `تم تصميم Resonance Healing.ai ليكون سهل الاستخدام، مما يجعل أي نوع من العلاج سهلًا. فقط قم بفتح شاشة Potentiser، اكتب اسم العلاج المطلوب، المعدل، أو ببساطة كلمة "COPY"، اختر القوة التي تحتاجها (X، C، D، M، CM، MM، LM)، ومعلومات مستوى الطاقة للعلاجات المكبرة. اضبط فترة المؤقت من 3 إلى 30 ثانية، ضع أقراصك الفارغة، كوب من الماء، أو أي وسيط آخر في بئر الاستقبال، اضغط ENTER، وسيكون علاجك جاهزًا.`,
    devicesParagraph2: `إذا كنت ترغب، يمكنك بعد ذلك "برمجة" هذا العلاج بخصائص محددة، مما يشكل علاجك ليناسب متطلباتك، ثم قم بقفله في الوسيط الحامل بحيث لن يتلاشى أو يفقد قوته، حتى إذا تم لمسه باليد أو وضعه بجانب مواد ذات رائحة قوية.`,
    devicesParagraph3: `بدلاً من ذلك، إذا كنت ترغب في صنع علاج متعدد بمكونات وتراكيز مختلفة، يمكن القيام بذلك في عملية واحدة باستخدام شاشة Potentiser. فقط أدخل معلومات العلاج في الحقول الأربعة للبيانات. يمكنك إنشاء وخلط علاجات الزهور، الأحجار الكريمة، والعلاجات الهوميوباثية، سواء مع أو بدون تراكيز هوميوباثية، في الوقت الذي يستغرقه كتابة المعلومات، بالإضافة إلى بضع ثوانٍ من وقت التفعيل.`,
    devicesParagraph4: `يتم إنشاء سجل تلقائي للعلاجات التي استخدمتها. يمكنك أيضًا عمل نسخ محفوظة بشكل دائم من تركيبات العلاج الخاصة بك واستدعائها بسهولة لاحقًا.`,
    devicesParagraph5: `الكلمة الرئيسية هنا هي المرونة. إذا كنت تفضل استخدام المعدلات، لا مشكلة. فقط اكتب معدلك، ويمكنك حتى إدخال الترددات والأشكال الموجية لاكتشاف عالم جديد من الاحتمالات العلاجية.`,
